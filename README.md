# Li_M_Roku
# Description
An audio and video app that uses queries and database assets. The user will be able to login and select either a parent section or a kids section, each with a unique theme. The sections will require a password. Content will be organized. The goal is to Create a fully responsive web application concept similar to Netflix using the Roku brand. The name of this concept is 'RokuFlashback' to represent how this application will bring you back in time by offering classic movies, shows and music of past decades.
