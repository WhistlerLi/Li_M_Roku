# Li_M_Roku

## Description
An audio and video app that uses queries and database assets. 
The user will be able to login and select either a parent section or a kids section and need password. 
Content will be organized. The goal is to Create a fully responsive web application concept similar to Netflix using the Roku brand. 

We will build an audio / video app in the Authoring class, using queries and database assets that youâ€™ll be compiling (or have compiled) in the Advanced Web class. 
Create assets based on the Roku Flashback brief (to be supplied) to create the layout, views and components you will be working with.
